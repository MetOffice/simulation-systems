Guides for Reviewers
====================

PRs will pass through a two-stage review. Linked PRs should work through this
process together.

The first, scitech, review is carried out by someone with a good understanding
of the area being developed. Once satisfied they then pass the PR to a
code reviewer who takes a bigger picture and system view of the change.
Trivial PRs can bypass the scitech review.

The change then passes to the Code Reviewer and in this stage the developer is
encouraged to merge ``main`` into their branch and resolve any conflicts.

Once the reviews are complete the code reviewer is then responsible for the
final merge and commit of the change to ``main``.
