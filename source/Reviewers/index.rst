Guides for Reviewers
====================

Tickets will pass through a two-stage review. Linked tickets should work
through this process together.

The first, scitech, review is carried out by someone with a good understanding
of the area being developed. Once satisfied they then pass the ticket to a
code reviewer who takes a bigger picture and system view of the change.
Trivial tickets can bypass the scitech review.

Once the reviews are complete the code reviewer is then responsible for merging
the change to trunk and committing it.
