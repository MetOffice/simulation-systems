Guides for Reviewers
====================

Tickets will pass through a two-stage review. Linked tickets should work
through this process together.

The first, scitech, review is carried out by someone with a good understanding
of the area being developed. Once satisfied they then pass the ticket to a
code reviewer who takes a bigger picture and system view of the change.
Trivial tickets can bypass the scitech review.

The change then passes to the Code Reviewer and in this stage the developer is
encouraged to merge ``main`` into their branch and resolve any conflicts.

Once the reviews are complete the code reviewer is then responsible for the
final merge and commit of the change to ``main``.
