UM Main Release
===============

Create a ticket and Create Branches
-----------------------------------

To document the process create a ticket and put a link to it on the release curation ticket. You may wish to include links to the UM and UM metadata branches required and a wiki page for the reviews.

.. code-block::

    Documents the 'Build and install the <main/test> UM release'

    NOTES: Any changes required that are not a direct instruction from this section of the guide.

    '''Branch :''' [log:main/branches/dev/branch_path_n_name dev/branch_path_n_name]
    '''Meta Branch :''' [log:meta/branches/dev/branch_path_n_name dev/branch_path_n_name]
    '''[wiki:ticket/ticket_no/CodeSystemReview Code/System Review]'''


Create and check out both a head of trunk UM branch and a head of trunk UM meta branch. Then update the ticket description.

.. code-block::

    fcm bc -k ticket_no vn11.5_um_release fcm:um.x_tr
    fcm co fcm:um.x_br/dev/username/r12345_vn11.5_um_release
    fcm bc -k ticket_no vn11.5_meta_release fcm:um_meta.x_tr
    fcm co fcm:um_meta.x_br/dev/username/r12345_vn11.5_meta_release


Tagging Feeder Trunks
---------------------

* :ref:`Tag <reference-tagging>` the head of the feeder repositories with keywords for the new UM version if they do not already exist.

* ``fcm:casim.x``
* ``fcm:jules.x``
* ``fcm:shumlib.x``
* ``fcm:socrates.x``
* ``fcm:ukca.x``

Send an email to all repository owners to let them know that the the head of the trunk has been tagged.

.. note::

    Jules should already have been done by the Jules release, but this is worth checking.


Apply Code Styling
------------------

* Switch to the UM branch
* Set ``export RUNFULL=1`` then run ./admin/code_styling/apply_styling
* If any files have changed, check nothing has gone wrong with a quick compile ``rose stem --group=fcm_make_ex1a_gnu_um_rigorous_omp``
* Commit any changes


Checking Metadata and Rose Apps
-------------------------------

The JULES release must be completed first and all jules-shared metadata changes from the JULES repository must be centrally installed before progressing.

* First switch to the UM branch.
* Check that the metadata meets the Rose standards: run ``rose config-dump -C rose-meta``. Do this before running release_new_version, so that any metadata errors are fixed before the new vnX.Y metadata directories are created, otherwise you'll have to check both vnX.Y and HEAD.

  * Run ``fcm diff`` on HEAD. Are the changes sensible? They often just involve moving sections of meta-data to be in the correct alphabetical order. However, `UM:#1824 <https://code.metoffice.gov.uk/trac/um/ticket/1824>`_ added comments for some additional triggers ([43853]) to circumvent a â€‹bug in Rose. Running config-dump will move the location of these comments to the bottom of the that item's metadata. Check for any moved references to "issue 2107" (there should be 4 of them) and put them back in the right places by hand, by referring to an unaltered copy of the trunk.

* Check rose-stem meets the Rose standards: run ``rose config-dump -C rose-stem/app``. The version upgrade macro should have reformatted all the atmos and fcm-make apps, so they should be correct. Are there any other changes (e.g. to rose-ana apps)? Are they understood? Commit them to the branch or discuss with the team as appropriate.
* Commit all changes before moving onto the next section


Running the Release Script
--------------------------

Move into the rose-stem directory in the UM working copy where the release new version script will be run from. The syntax is,

.. code-block::

    ../admin/rose-stem/release_new_version.py -c <previous version> -n <new version> -j <new *JULES* version>
    eg. ../admin/rose-stem/release_new_version.py -c 13.4 -n 13.5 -j 7.5

* Open a new terminal and inspect that the version number update macro added by the script is correct, and that the tXXXX template macro has been deleted appropriately.

  * This has caused problems before see `this edge case <https://code.metoffice.gov.uk/trac/um/wiki/ticket/2437/SciTechReview>`_. The upgrade macro should fail to execute if the macro chain is incorrect, as it won't be able to upgrade an app to the new version - this is likely this edge case.


Copying the metadata and upgrade macros to the um_meta branch
-------------------------------------------------------------

The next step is to move the macros and metadata into the meta branch. The metadata will have been created already by the release script.
Below shows an example of the commands run to move from 11.4 to 11.5, from the top directory of the working copy of the UM branch,

.. code-block::

    version="version114_115.py"
    vn="vn11.5"
    path="/path/to/meta/working_copy"

    fcm mv rose-meta/um-atmos/$version $path/um-atmos/$version
    fcm mv rose-meta/um-fcm-make/$version $path/um-fcm-make/$version
    fcm mv rose-meta/um-createbc/$version $path/um-createbc/$version

    fcm mv rose-meta/um-atmos/$vn $path/um-atmos/$vn
    fcm mv rose-meta/um-fcm-make/$vn $path/um-fcm-make/$vn
    fcm mv rose-meta/um-createbc/$vn $path/um-createbc/$vn

Note: there is no need to move um-crmstyle as it only contains HEAD metadata.

Manually add a line to each of the um-atmos/versions.py, um-fcm-make/versions.py and um-createbc/versions.py files in the meta branch to import the newly copied versionXX_XY.py file.

Commit the changes to both the UM and Meta branches.


Final Checks
------------

**UM AUX Changes**

If there are changes to the AUX trunk in this release, are we picking up the head of the AUX trunk (fcm:um_aux)?
A new keyword will need to be created and copied into the rose-stem/rose-suite.conf file.

.. code-block::

    fcm co -q -N fcm:um_aux.x aux
    fcm log -l1 fcm:um_aux.x/trunk
    cd aux
    fcm pe fcm:revision .
    fcm commit

.. warning::

    Updating ``HOST_SOURCE_UM_AUX`` with the new keyword is NOT done automatically by release_new_version.py as it doesn't need to be done every release

**Other Points**

* Make sure the prebuilds are set to ``true`` in the ``site/meto/variables.cylc`` by checking the line, ``{% do SITE_VARS.update({"PREBUILDS" : true}) %}``
* Check rose-stem/rose-suite.conf?

  * Are the UM, JULES, SOCRATES, CASIM and UKCA versions correct? These should be the keywords setup earlier.
  * Is housekeeping ``true``?
  * Are the KGO versions correct in the ``variables.cylc`` file for each site?
  * Does the minimum version of Rose/Cylc need to be increased? (Do any rose-ana changes require new functionality?)
  * Do any of the apps or parts of the suites reference ``$UMDIR`` - they shouldn't (the correct thing to do is to reference ``$UM_INSTALL_DIR``).

* ``grep`` for any instances of the old version keyword(s). Fix as required and add any corrections to the instructions on this page too.

Commit any changes resulting from these final checks.


Preparing to Test
-----------------

.. important::

    When referring to **all** platforms below, this means Azure Spice, EXAB, EXCD, EXZ


* Check that a ``$UMDIR/standard_jobs/inputs/vnX.Y`` input data directory exists in UMDIR on **all** platforms - this should have been done as part of the test release.

  * If not, rename the inputs directory ``$UMDIR/standard_jobs/inputs/vnX.Y`` to the new version number and be sure to symlink the previous version to it. Do this all on one line to minimise any glitches during the rename. This needs to be repeated on all platforms. i.e. to update from vn11.5 to vn11.6 one would run, ``mv vn11.5 vn11.6; ln -s vn11.6 vn11.5``.

* Local keywords for the UM should be put in your ``~/.metomi/fcm/keyword.cfg`` file on **all** platforms (don't forget to remove them afterwards). The tag should correspond to the version you are releasing and the version number should be the revision of the trunk from which you branched. For example:

  .. code-block::

    revision[um.x:vn10.0]                    = 112
    revision[um.xm:vn10.0]                   = 112

* For the rose_ana tasks to pass new KGO also needs to be generated for the new version, since you are about to run the ``all`` group test anyway you should use this opportunity to produce a new set of KGO.

  * KGO is installed using the scripts in SimSys_Scripts. In order for the script to work you must first change the KGO directories in the ``variables.cylc`` and platform-specific ``variables_PLATFORM.cylc`` files back to whichever versions were present before the ``release_new_version.py`` script was run - you can do this with a simple copy from the head of the trunk. Be careful to ensure this is only changing the KGO versions for each variable as expected. **DO NOT COMMIT this change - you will be reverting it later**.

  .. code-block::

    fcm export --force fcm:um.x_tr/rose-stem/site/meto/variables.cylc rose-stem/site/meto/
    fcm export --force fcm:um.x_tr/rose-stem/site/meto/variables_azspice.cylc rose-stem/site/meto/
    fcm export --force fcm:um.x_tr/rose-stem/site/meto/variables_ex1a.cylc rose-stem/site/meto/

  * Current KGO files will have the older UM version in the fixed length header and lookups. In order for the rose-ana tasks that use mule-cumf to not give false rose-ana failures we must temporarily ignore the model version. There is some logic in the UM rose stem suite to enable this. Open your ``~/.metomi/rose.conf`` file, on **all** platforms, and add the following lines to the rose-ana section, making sure that bypass-version-check is true:

  .. code-block::

    [rose-ana]
    bypass-version-check=.true.


Testing and KGO Generation
--------------------------

As yourself, and in the working copy of the UM branch run rose stem, be sure not to forget the source argument to the UM metadata branch,

.. code-block::

    rose stem --task=all -S PREBUILDS=false -S HOUSEKEEPING=false -S USE_EXAB=true --source=. --source=/path/to/metadata/working_copy
    cylc play <name-of-suite>

Before continuing the next step you should make sure the suite has run as expected. All tests should pass apart from any tasks that output netcdf (these have _nc in the tasks name) and the SCM tasks. Both of these encode the UM version and use a direct comparison, it is not as simple to exclude UM version from the comparison as we did with tests that use mule-cumf.

.. tip::

    Check the test results by running something like

    .. code-block::

        find ~cylc-run/<suite name>/runN/log/job -path "*rose_ana*" -type f -name job.status | xargs grep -l CYLC_JOB_EXIT=ERR | grep -vE "(scm|netcdf)"

The ``meto_update_kgo.sh`` script is stored in SimSys_Scripts. As yourself, navigate to ``$UMDIR/SimSys_Scripts/kgo_updates`` directory and run ``./meto_update_kgo.sh --new-release`` and follow its instructions.

* First it will ask for all platforms run on, ``azspice ex1a``
* It will ask which Host Zone the tests ran on - we specified EXAB so choose that (Host Zone 1).
* You will need to supply the username and suitename of the suite you ran above. This will need to include the ``runX`` directory.
* The version number should be the new version.
* The ticket number won't be used but can be entered as the ticket associated with the release.
* When asked how the new kgo directory should be named overwrite the default with the name ``vnX.Y`` where this is the new version number.
* It will show you the settings to double check before you continue.

  * Pay particular attention to the preview of the list of commands the script will present you with to ensure it has accounted for all expected KGO files.

* The script will install the new kgo on every platform in order azspice->ex1a. Once these are finished installing it will rsync to the EXCD and EXZ. To install the entire kgo database will take some time.

Once you believe you have installed the KGO you should fcm revert the changes you made to the variables*.cylc files to reset the KGO variables, ``fcm revert rose-stem/site/meto/variables*``

The test suite should now be rerun to confirm the kgo has been installed properly. As we can't restart Cylc8 rose-stem suites, the entire thing needs to be rerun. We're just checking that the kgo has been installed, so it's probably unnecessary to wait for the entire thing - instead just ensure a reasonable range of rose-ana tasks have passed.

.. tip::

    Has the ability to reload the test suite been enabled yet? If so ``cylc vr`` can likely be used to restart the original suite. These instructions also need updating!


Review and Commit
-----------------

Ensure all changes are committed to both branches and then pass along for a review to someone in the team.

Notes for Reviewer:

* In ``rose-stem/site/meto/variables``, ensure the ``PREBUILDS`` variable near the top is set to true.
* Once happy, commit both the meta and main branches, and return the ticket to the developer.

Now :ref:`tag <reference-tagging>` the trunk with the ``vnX.Y = RRR`` tag.

**Now make sure to revert changes to ``~/.metomi/fcm/keyword.cfg`` on all platforms**


Install the Release
-------------------

The main installation of ctldata, utilities and prebuilds can now take place. This all takes place as the ``umadmin`` account so log in to that now.

Delete any remaining temporary vnX.Y keywords for umadmin/umtest, on **all** platforms. Check all keyword.cfg files, and do both accounts now. They could be left over from the earlier test build, even if you didn't set them.

Check out the UM trunk into a working copy. ``umadmin`` can only check out from the mirror.

.. code-block::

    fcm co fcm:um.xm_tr@vnX.Y umX.Y_install
    cd umX.Y_install

First check that the upgrade has gone successfully and the new install will appear in the correct place. Do this by running,

.. code-block::

    rose stem --group=install rose-stem -S CENTRAL_INSTALL=false -S PREBUILDS=false -S USE_EXAB=true
    cylc play <name-of-suite>

and check that ``~umadmin/cylc_run/<working_copy_name>/runN/share/vnX.Y`` exists and is the new version number. If that has worked, change the CENTRALL_INSTALL flag to true and rerun,

.. code-block::

    rose stem --group=install rose-stem -S CENTRAL_INSTALL=true -S PREBUILDS=false -S USE_EXAB=true
    cylc play <name-of-suite>


Next, rerun the install for the 2nd host zone,

.. code-block::

    rose stem --group=install rose-stem -S CENTRAL_INSTALL=false -S PREBUILDS=false -S USE_EXCD=true
    cylc play <name-of-suite>

Finally, rerun the install for the EXZ,

.. code-block::

    rose stem --group=install rose-stem -S CENTRAL_INSTALL=false -S PREBUILDS=false -S USE_EXZ=true
    cylc play <name-of-suite>

The release is now installed and can be announced.

Make Release Prebuilds
----------------------

Now it is time to install the prebuilds.

.. important::

    Use Cylc 7 (``export CYLC_VERSION=7``) to install the prebuilds. It is important to set the source to the UM fcm mirror in the commands below, and use the config option to point at the rose-stem directory. If this wasn't done, prebuild availability would depend on the host machine you are currently on being available. rose-stem in cylc8 doesn't support this, hence using cylc7.

    A fix for this will likely become available with the move to git. The timescales for that are shorter than for removing Cylc7.

First install the prebuilds on Azure Spice and EXAB,

.. code-block::

    export CYLC_VERSION=7
    rose stem --group=prebuilds --source=fcm:um.xm_tr@vnX.Y --name=vnX.Y_prebuilds --config=./rose-stem -S MAKE_PREBUILDS=true -S USE_EXAB=true

And then on the EXCD - make sure to **not** use ``--new`` in this command or the previous set will have been overwritten.

.. code-block::

    export CYLC_VERSION=7
    rose stem --group=ex1a_fcm_make,ex1a_fcm_make_portio2b --source=fcm:um.xm_tr@vnX.Y --name=vnX.Y_prebuilds --config=./rose-stem -S MAKE_PREBUILDS=true -S USE_EXCD=true

And finally on the EXZ - make sure to **not** use ``--new`` in this command or the previous set will have been overwritten.

.. code-block::

    export CYLC_VERSION=7
    rose stem --group=ex1a_fcm_make,ex1a_fcm_make_portio2b --source=fcm:um.xm_tr@vnX.Y --name=vnX.Y_prebuilds --config=./rose-stem -S MAKE_PREBUILDS=true -S USE_EXZ=true
