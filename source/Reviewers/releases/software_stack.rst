Scientific Software Stack Update
================================

* The scientific software stack used for the UM rose-stem is in
  ``rose-stem/site/meto/variables.cylc`` file and in ``admin/search_stash.sh``
* Decide whether this needs updating - using the latest production scitools
  environment is recommended.
* If you decide to update then complete with an associated PR.

.. note::

    This process will want revisiting if the UM moves towards a spack software
    stack, similar to LFRic
