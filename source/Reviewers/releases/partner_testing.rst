Partner Testing
===============

This is intended to allow partners to determine if there are any undetected problems with the head of the UM trunk (and its dependencies) before the release process gets started in earnest.

The partner testing period should be 72 hours (3 working days). All tickets affecting the main source code should be committed (to all repos) but limited scope changes, eg. to just the Met Office site, can still go on.

* Open a pre-release testing ticket to record responses, issues etc (eg. see `UM:#7795 <https://code.metoffice.gov.uk/trac/um/ticket/7795>`_.)
* Add the latest UM, Jules, UKCA, Casim, Socrates revisions to the ticket.
* Email the representatives at each UM partner site to them to test. A list of emails can be found at, `UM Partner Testing Emails <https://code.metoffice.gov.uk/trac/um/wiki/UMPartnerTesting>`_ (note, that page should remain private to the Met Office).

  * You may need to set the international options in advanced email sending options to use Unicode (UTF-8) as the preferred encoding for outgoing messages to ensure that all international partners receive the email. Change this setting if you receive bounced emails during partner testing.


.. important::

    Now is also a good time to ask for the Jules release notes. This is usually done by a member of the Jules community, so email them advising them of the likely release date. Ask the team for their details if unsure.
