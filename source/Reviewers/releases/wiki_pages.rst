Standard Jobs and Wiki Pages
============================

Standard Jobs Page
------------------

This involves creating a new `Standard Jobs <https://code.metoffice.gov.uk/trac/um/wiki/StandardJobs>`_ for the new release. First update the index page with the new release, then copy the previous release page to the new one, deleting the jobs table within. Check through for all references to the previous release, updating them. Also update the links to the resources pages - we will create these later. Complete a review of the rest of the standard jobs page, updating anything that requires it.

Checkout a copy of the UM trunk at release and then run the following command to create the new standard jobs table,

.. code-block::

    ./admin/create_stdjobs.py . >> output.txt

Copy the output to the new page.

We also include resource tables used by the suite at release - the links to these pages should have been updated earlier. The resources tables can be generated by running,

.. code-block::

    ./admin/rose-stem/produce_resources.py /path/to/cylc-run_suite_directory/

This requires a cylc-run directory of the ``all`` group (or individual ones for each platform). Usually the nightly testing from ``umtest`` can be used.


Wiki Pages

Review and update the following pages, modifying version numbers as required:

* Page Templates
