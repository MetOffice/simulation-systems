Committing Linked Tickets
=========================

How do linked tickets work?
---------------------------
Linked tickets contain changes that all need to be committed together to work
successfully. With only some of the changes committed the repositories are
considered "out of sync", with some of the test suites likely to fail as the
api between the codebases is broken. For this reason, where possible, all parts
of a linked ticket should be committed on the same day to avoid nightly tests
failing.

:ref:`Multi-repository <multirepo>` changes are nested, and the different
branches will need approaching in the correct order. The UM and LFRIc Apps are
the key places where these overlap.

1. Everything except UM and LFRic Apps can be worked on separately and should
   be committed first.

2. LFRic Apps and the UM each rely on code from all of the above code bases,
   and will need that code for both testing and committing. They do not rely on
   each other.

.. tip::

   While it is possible to work through the commit process for each repository
   in turn, following this list in order, this can take a lot of time and so it
   is prudent to parallelise the process where possible.

   A suggested sequence would be as follows:

   1. Complete the merge and macro stages for every repository. These steps are
      entirely isolated and so order doesn't matter.

   2. Test all of the changes together as described below.

   3. Install KGO files for all repositories requiring them

   4. Commit the tickets as described below.


.. _testinglinked:

Testing linked tickets
----------------------
With the branches from all the tickets merged into a working copy of their
respective Head of Trunk these can all be used together to test the change.

Details for testing multi-repository tickets are included on the
:ref:`Working with Multiple Repositories page <multirepo>`.

**In summary:**

- JULES, UKCA, LFRic Core and other child repositories can be tested using
  their standalone test suites as described on the How to Commit page.

- Local working copies can be passed to the UM on the command line

  .. code-block:: shell

   rose stem --group=developer,ukca,jules --source=. \
    --source=/path/to/jules/working/copy \
    --source=/path/to/ukca/working/copy

  Make sure you test the group that will exercise the interface between those
  repositories (e.g. in the above example the jules and ukca groups are
  tested).

- Local working copies of any linked JULES, UKCA or other repositories can be
  passed to LFRic Apps through ``<lfric_apps_trunk>/dependencies.sh``.

.. code-block:: shell

   jules_sources=vldXXX:/path/to/um/working/copy


.. tip::

   It is always important that branches and working copies used for testing
   multiple repositories together have been taken at the same point in time.
   If this isn't the case then API breaking changes may be included in one
   repository but not another which will cause tests to fail.

   The developer will likely have used branches taken from the last releases
   which are a known set of stable revisions which work together.

   Make sure the testing done here (just prior to commit) is using the latest
   head of all the trunks. Assuming nightly tests are passing then this is
   also a known set of revisions that work together.

.. tip::

   If some of the changes in this set of tickets have already been committed
   then see steps 2 and 4 below on how to include those changes in your
   testing. This is instead of the steps described above.

   e.g. If JULES changes have been committed and the revision number modified
   in rose-suite.conf then the working copy no longer needs supplying as a
   `source` to the UM testing.

Committing linked tickets
-------------------------

Once you are happy with all your testing then the commit sequence is as follows:

1. Commit all trunks **except** UM and LFRic Apps. Make note of the commit
   revision numbers.

2. Update <um_trunk>/rose-stem/rose-suite.conf

  * Modify ``HOST_SOURCE_*`` for all child repositories involved to point to
    the new commit revisions.
  * e.g. If a JULES ticket has just been committed at revision 12345

  .. code-block:: shell

    HOST_SOURCE_JULES='fcm:jules.xm_tr@12345'

3. Commit UM

4. Update <lfric_apps_trunk>/dependencies.sh

  * Modify ``*_rev`` variables for all other repositories you have updated to
    point to the the new commit revisions.
  * Remove any branch references from the ``*_sources`` variables.
  * e.g. If a JULES ticket has been committed at revision 12345 and a UKCA
    ticket at 6789

  .. code-block:: shell

    export ukca_rev=6789
    export jules_rev=12345

    export ukca_sources=
    export jules_sources=

5. Commit LFRic Apps

You may choose to run a subset of tests before completing the UM and LFRic Apps
commits in turn to validate your changes.
