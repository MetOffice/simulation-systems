Support
=======

Level 0- Self help & Peer Support
---------------------------------

Self-help and using the people around you should always be your first port of
call. Time spent here will likely solve your problem or at least better
describe it.

Consider contacting relevant Code, Configuration or Suite Owners.

Level 1- GitHub Discussions
---------------------------
If your problem persists, then describe and discuss it on GitHub Discussions:

* `LFRic <https://github.com/MetOffice/simulation-systems/discussions/categories/lfric>`__
* `UM <https://github.com/MetOffice/simulation-systems/discussions/categories/um>`__
* `JULES <https://github.com/MetOffice/simulation-systems/discussions/categories/jules>`__
* `Mule <https://github.com/MetOffice/simulation-systems/discussions/categories/mule>`__

Level 2- Support Teams
----------------------

If you still require assistance, then contact the appropriate support team.
Please respect the clear demarcations between the scope for different teams.

Core Capability Development Team (formally LFRic Team):
    * Support windows for LFRic releases TBC

Simulation Systems and Deployment Team (formerly UM System Team and CRUM team)
supports:

    * UM, Shumlib and JULES versions released in the last 12 months,
    * main version used in the Met Office Operational Suite.
    * specific climate configurations .. todo - details of which configs


Escalation
----------

Sometimes things go wrong or different parties disagree. If discussions between
developer, code/config owners and reviewers cannot resolve the situation then
it should be escalated to the manager of the Simulation Systems and Deployment
Team in the first instance. They will consult appropriately to make the best
balanced and impartial decision. If this is unsuccessful, the ultimate
(but very rarely used) decision authority about code that may be committed to
the trunk lies with the Simulation Systems Governance Group.
