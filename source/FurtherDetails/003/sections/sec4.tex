\section{Code reviews}
\label{sec:reviews}

In order to ensure that these standards are adhered to and are having the desired effect code reviews must be held. Reviews can also be useful in disseminating computing skills. To this end two types of code review are performed in the order below: 

\begin{enumerate}
  \item A science/technical review is performed first to ensure that the code
  performs as it is intended, it complies with the standards and is well
  documented.  Guidance for reviewers is found in the \href{https://code.metoffice.gov.uk/trac/um/wiki/WorkingPractices/SciReviewGuidance}{Science/Technical Review Guidance} page on the UM homepage.
  \item A code/system review is performed to analyse the change for its 
  impact, ensure that it meets this coding standard  
  and to ensure that all concerned parties are made aware of changes that are
  required.  Guidance for reviewers is outlined in \href{https://code.metoffice.gov.uk/trac/um/wiki/WorkingPractices/CodeReviewGuidance}{Code/System Review Guidance} page on the UM homepage.  

\end{enumerate}
