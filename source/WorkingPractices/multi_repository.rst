Working with Multiple Repositories
==================================
The repositories covered by these working practices all interact with and have
dependencies on each other. This means that changes that affect multiple
repositories need handling with extra care.

LFRic Apps and the UM both act as top level parents to a number of child
repositories such as JULES, UKCA, SOCRATES and CASIM. These child repositories
work independently as well as being used by the parent repositories. LFRic Apps
also utilises the infrastructure in LFRic Core.

This means that changes to the science code in any of the child repositories
will need testing with both the UM and LFRic Apps to check for any interactions.

.. note::
    From LFRic Apps vn2.1 and UM vn13.8 there are duplicate copies of the
    physics code in both the UM and LFRic Apps.
    Consideration should be made at to whether changes to the physics schemes are
    best made in LFRic Apps, the UM or both. If in doubt then the copy in LFRic
    Apps is considered the master version.

Preparing Linked Tickets
------------------------
Every repository in a set of linked changes requires a ticket. Guidance on
setting these up can be found in :ref:`ticket`. These tickets will be treated
as a group with the same reviewers and committed at the same time.

Do:
    * Make sure every ticket has a cross reference to the others in the set, e.g. ``um:#1234``
    * Use :ref:`keywords` to show which other repositories are involved
    * Get the tickets ready for review at the same time
    * Ask for help testing if you don't have access to all the codebases involved

.. important::
    Code branches in linked tickets will require branching from compatible revisions
    to ensure they work together.

    If working with branches from a release then all repositories will  be tagged
    with suitable keywords, e.g. for UM vn13.0, other repositories are also tagged
    with um13.0.

    For head of trunk revisions make sure that all branches/revisions being used
    are at least as recent as the versions listed in the `_rev` parameter of
    `<lfric_apps_trunk>/dependencies.sh`, or `<um_trunk>/rose-stem/rose-suite.conf`.

    If in doubt, please contact the Simulation Systems and Deployment Team for advice.
