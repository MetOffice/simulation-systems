The first step to the begin the review process in github is to open a pull request. A pull request shows the proposed changes to the target branch and provides a space for reviews and discussion to take place. There a number of ways of opening a pull request. If your branch has had recent changes, then a box may appear in the either of the Upstream or Fork github pages, with a button to create the fork.

Alternatively, navigate to the github page of your fork and select the ``Contribute`` button,
