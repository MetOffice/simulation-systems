Creating and Managing Forks
===========================

.. tip::

    For more information see the `github documentation <https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks>`_

Forks are repositories that share code and visibility settings with the upstream repository. They provide a place for development work to take place while allowing the upstream repo to maintain limited write access. Forks can all merge branches with each other as well as with the upstream repository, meaning a pull request can be opened to merge a branch in a fork into the upstream main.

Creating a Fork
---------------

Creating a fork is something that only needs to be done once per upstream repository. Once created, branches can be created in the fork as desired by the owner.

.. tab-set::

    .. tab-item:: Web Browser

        First navigate to the upstream repository you wish to fork. Then select the fork button.

        .. image:: images/gh_screenshots/fork_button_light.png
            :class: only-light border

        .. image:: images/gh_screenshots/fork_button_dark.png
            :class: only-dark border

        On the next page you can rename your fork if desired and select which branches to fork - ensure this box is unticked to fork all branches.

        .. important::

            Ensure the option to only clone the default branch is unticked.

        .. image:: images/gh_screenshots/fork_page_light.png
            :class: only-light border

        .. image:: images/gh_screenshots/fork_page_dark.png
            :class: only-dark border

    .. tab-item:: gh cli

        Run the following command, substituting for the required upstream owner and repository name,

        .. code-block::

            gh repo fork <OWNER>/<REPO>

        .. tip::

            Add ``--clone`` to immediately clone the forked repo


Maintaining a Fork
------------------

Most work to maintain a fork involves syncing it with the upstream repository. Syncing a fork will ensure that changes to the upstream repository are copied into the fork. Syncing is done on a per branch basis. For example, after a new release, syncing the ``stable`` branch will ensure the forks ``stable`` branch contains the newly released code.

.. important::

    It is recommended that developers do not modify the synced branches from upstream in their forks as this may cause issues with merge conflicts when syncing a fork. Instead all work should be carried out in a branch.

.. tab-set::

    .. tab-item:: Web Browser

        Navigate to your fork in github that you wish to sync. Select the ``Sync Fork`` button and if required, update the branch. This will only sync the branch you are currently on - to sync other branches select one from the branch dropdown menu. You may want to sync both ``stable`` and ``main``, particularly at a release.

        .. image:: images/gh_screenshots/sync_fork_light.png
            :class: only-light border

        .. image:: images/gh_screenshots/sync_fork_dark.png
            :class: only-dark border

        The synced branch will still only exist in the remote repository. If you require them in a local clone make sure to ``fetch`` or ``pull`` the repository.

    .. tab-item:: gh cli

        Run the following command, substituting for the downstream fork owner and repo name. Without the ``-b`` option, only the default branch will be synced. You may want to sync both ``stable`` and ``main``, particularly at a release.

        .. code-block::

            gh repo sync <OWNER>/<REPO> -b <BRANCH>

        The synced branch will still only exist in the remote repository. If you require them in a local clone make sure to ``fetch`` or ``pull`` the repository.

    .. tab-item:: git commands

        Ensure that the upstream repository is available as a remote source and
        the latest changes have been fetched. See :ref:`setting git remote
        sources <git_remote>` for more details.

        Then run the following commands for each branch you wish to sync. The example below will use ``main``.

        .. code-block::

            # Checkout the desired branch
            git checkout main

            # Merge in changes from the upstream
            git merge upstream/main

            # Push the changes back to the remote fork
            git push
