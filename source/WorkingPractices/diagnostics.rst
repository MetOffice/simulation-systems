Diagnostic Systems
==================

The diagnostic systems vary between projects. Please follow the guidance for
whichever system you are developing.

+-------+----------------------+
| UM    | :ref:`STASH <stash>` |
+-------+----------------------+
| LFRic | :ref:`lfric_diag`    |

  Do UKCA/SOCRATES/JULES have their own diagnostic systems and are they worth mentioning here?
  CASIM does not, but the MONC model which builds CASIM does; code is shared between them both.
