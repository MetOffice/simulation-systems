Known Good Output (KGO)
=======================

Normally it is to be expected that code changes regress (i.e. all prognostic
variables **and** diagnostics maintain the same answers with your code included
but switched off).

Usually, a code change does not regress when either a bug is a
discovered and fixed, or a science area is introduced or enhanced. Sometimes,
a KGO update may also be required to simply add a new job to the
test suite or to port the rose stem suite to new HPC architecture.

**LFRic** KGO checksums are stored in the repository. As such with LFRic tickets
the expectation is that you, as the developer, will include updated KGO files
as part of your branch.

**UM and JULES** KGO output files are stored outside of the repository. Access
to this area is restricted to members of the Simulation Systems and Deployment
Team and they will update the KGO files to include your new answers as part of
the commit process.


KGO Update Process
------------------

Getting the process right for KGO changing tickets significantly helps get
such changes onto the trunk. When preparing your change for review:

1. Run the ``all`` rose-stem group in order to make sure that all
   changes to answers have been found.

   * Include the :ref:`trac.log <traclog>` output from this testing in your ticket summary.

2. Add the ``kgo`` keyword to your ticket.

    .. tab-item:: LFRic Apps

        3. Update the checksum files on your branch. To do so run rose stem and
           then the following from the head of your working copy

           .. code-block::

              python3 ./rose-stem/bin/update_branch_kgos.py -s <suite name/runX> -w <path to working copy>

           .. note::
              This script requires at least python 3.9. This can be achieved on
              Met Office machines by running ``module load scitools``

        4. You can check the new kgo updated properly by retiggering tasks in the test suite. First retrigger
        ``export-source``, and then when complete ``export-source_xc40`` if new checksums are present there
        (there is no need to retigger spice). You may need to change the maximum window extent of the gui in
        order to see the succeeded tasks. Now you can retrigger the failed checksums - these should now pass
        if the kgo was updated in the working copy correctly. If you are adding new checksums, then ``fcm add``
        the files before these steps.

        5. The changes in answers should be science reviewed by someone familiar with the failing tests -
        if unsure then start with the Code Owner for the affected application.


        Once all the above is in place and the science and code reviews have been completed
        then the Code Reviewer will merge your change to the head of trunk. If there are
        merge conflicts in the checksum files then the reviewer will repeat step 3
        to refresh these files. Your change is then committed to trunk.

    .. tab-item:: UM & JULES

        3. Contact the configuration owners of all affected configurations. A list is
           provided in the trac.log . See :ref:`approvals` for details.

           Configuration owners will review the change and will either accept the change
           as it is, or will request the use of a temporary variable to switch the
           change off. See :ref:`templogicals` for details of this process.

        Once all of the above is in place and the science and code reviews have been
        completed the Code Reviewer will merge the branch to the head of trunk, run the
        tests that have changed answers and use those results to install KGO files to
        the filesystem. Your change is then committed to trunk.
