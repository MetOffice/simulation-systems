Rose Stem Suite
===============

All new changes are strongly encouraged to come with an update to the
rose stem suite to protect any new functionality. Configuration owners may also
wish to update the suite to ensure that important configurations are protected
by the rose stem suite.

.. todo: this could be fleshed out with some details on how to acheive that?

.. warning::
  If you find that you need to update all the apps in the rose stem suite
  purely to get your change to work, you are probably doing something wrong.
  Most likely, you need an upgrade macro. See :ref:`inputs`.
