Multi-Repository Testing
========================

Multi-repository changes are expected to pass the regression tests for all the
repositories involved. To carry out the tests involved in a linked ticket it can
be helpful to refer to the :ref:`repository figure <multirepo>`; Testing both
child and parent repositories as needed. Further details of how testing in each
repository is handled can be found on the :ref:`Testing page<testing>`. Compatible
code revisions are needed for testing across repositories as described above.

Testing changes in JULES, LFRic Core, UKCA, or any other child repositories is
as simple as running the standalone test procedures for these codebases.

.. important::

    When specifying an alternative source in the ``dependencies.sh`` file the revision for the source **must** be updated.

    * If setting the source as an fcm URL, the mirror (``.xm_``) needs to be used and the revision can either be blank (for latest commit) or any valid revision for that branch.
    * If setting the source as a Working Copy, the hostname needs to be provided (as Hostname:Path) and the revision must be blank.

Testing the UM with other repositories
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To test the UM, any changes to JULES, UKCA, Socrates, CASIM etc will also need
to be included. This is done by adding another source to the rose stem command
line.

1. :ref:`Checkout<checkout>` a UM working copy
    - this may be your branch from a linked ticket, or a clean trunk copy
      at either the last release or a suitable head of trunk revision.

2. Run rose stem, including a source code path to every branch involved. As a minimum
   run ``developer`` group and all groups that cover the repositories being tested.

.. code-block::

    rose stem --group=developer,jules,ukca --source=. --source=/path/to/jules/changes --source=/path/to/ukca/changes

The source paths involved can either be to local working copies or links to the
fcm source control e.g. ``fcm:jules.xm_br/dev/user/branch_name``. As many source
paths as needed can be added to the list.

Testing LFRic Apps with other repositories
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

LFRic Apps testing needs to encompass all of the other repositories affected.
Paths to the other codebases involved should be added to
``dependencies.sh`` under each of the ``*_sources`` variables. Again
these paths can either be to local changes or those in the repository.

1. :ref:`Checkout<checkout>` an LFRic Apps working copy

- this may be your branch from a linked ticket, or a clean trunk copy
  at either the last release or a suitable head of trunk revision.

2. Update dependencies.sh to point to all other code changes, e.g.

.. code-block:: RST

    lfric_core_rev=
    lfric_core_sources=fcm:lfric.xm_br/path/to/branch

    casim_rev=
    casim_sources=vldXXX:/path/to/casim/working/copy

3a. Run the lfric_atm developer test-suite

- suitable for testing changes in other repositories that do not
  include any LFRic Apps changes

.. code-block::

    export CYLC_VERSION=8
    rose stem --group=lfric_atm_developer
    cylc play <working copy name>
    cylc gui

3b. Run the full developer test-suite

- suitable for testing LFRic Apps changes with other repositories, or expanding
  testing if lfric_atm tests have shown errors.

.. code-block::

    export CYLC_VERSION=8
    rose stem --group=developer
    cylc play <working copy name>
    cylc gui

More details on LFRic Apps testing are found on the 
:ref:`Testing LFRic Apps page<lfric_apps_test>`.

.. note::
    If any of the testing shows up failures then there are two possible ways to
    proceed:

    1. The changes made should be re-written to avoid breaking the dependant
       repositories

    2. The changes made directly affect the interface between repositories and
       therefore a change is also needed to the parent repository to adapt to that change.

    If you're uncertain which route to take then the Code Owners involved will
    hopefully be able to advise.
