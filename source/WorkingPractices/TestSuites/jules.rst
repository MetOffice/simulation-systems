Testing JULES
=============

JULES testing is run with the following command from a working copy:

    .. code-block::

        rose stem --group=all --new

-----

The JULES rose stem testing includes a range of builds using a variety of compilers,
several configurations, and rose-ana tasks to check the output.

The output is checked for correctness both by comparing the output to a set of
stored :ref:`KGO files <kgo>`.

.. note::

    If there are JULES changes to shared science code or
    :ref:`jules-shared<shared-namelists>` metadata then these changes
    will need to be tested :ref:`with the UM<um_testing>` and
    :ref:`with LFRic Apps<lfric_apps_test>`. If you have access to LFRic, the
    :ref:`traclog` will state whether LFRic testing is required based on the branch
    diff. If you do not have LFRic access, this testing will need to be completed by
    your Met Office contact.

    See :ref:`multirepo` for details on how to carry out this testing.

    .. important::
      For **jules-shared** changes, when LFRic testing, the changes
      need to be manually synced to the LFRic location. When UM
      testing, this is not required as **jules-shared** is imported
      from the JULES branch.

Below is a (by no means comprehensive) set of groups that you may wish to use on
Met Office systems.
