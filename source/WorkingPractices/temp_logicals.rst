Temporary Logical Variables
===========================

Temporary logical variables are intended to add a layer of protection in
instances where a *bug fix* produces a **significant** change in results in a
scientific configuration. The purpose of the temporary logical is to maintain
results in scientific configurations. However, the bug fix could either be due
to a scientific or a technical issue. Temporary logicals are used primarily for
two reasons:

#. To maintain consistency in an important scientific configuration (e.g.,
   global/regional atmosphere/land) when upgrading between model versions. If
   the logical was not used then different model versions may lead to very
   different scientific answers.

#. To give the configuration owner time to assess the impact of a significant
   change in answers on their configuration. The usual release cycle window is
   often too short to fully assess the impact of anything other than a small
   change.

Neither of these statements suggest that the fix shouldn't be included --- in
fact the opposite is true. The decision as to whether to include a temporary
logical normally rests with the configuration owner, but with guidance from the
CodeSys reviewer and the Simulation Systems and Deployment team. In such cases,
the following guidance is followed:

* Essential bug fixes (e.g. something which would on occasions cause the model
  to crash) should be switched on by default and would **not** have a temporary
  logical.

  * This includes any bug fixes which restores bit comparison across different
    processor decomposition where it has been previously broken.

* Any bug fix which does not lead to a change in answers should be switched on
  by default (not with a temporary logical).

* Small changes (within the noise) can usually be included as a :ref:`kgo`
  update and would **not** usually have a temporary logical associated with
  them.

* Anything which has a large impact (especially on key variables used for
  weather and climate) and which extends beyond the 'noise' of the model
  **would be expected to include a temporary logical**.

* There may be a few specific cases, where only certain platforms or builds are
  affected due to a technical bug fix.

.. important::
   There isn't a precise definition of what 'being in the noise' consists of, so
   the configuration owner should always be contacted in the first instance to
   provide guidance of what is or is not important to that particular
   configuration.

.. important::
   Remember that any new piece of science code or new scientific option would
   normally be switched off by default by a variable in the most appropriate
   scientific namelist. A temporary logical would not be used in this instance.
   See :ref:`input variables <inputs>` for further details.

Adding a temporary logical to the code base
-------------------------------------------

When adding a new temporary logical, the developer must protect **only** the
portion of code which changes answers by placing an `IF` statement around it,
e.g.,

.. code-block::

  IF (l_fix_something) THEN

    ... piece of code which changes answers ...

  END IF ! l_fix_something

The new logical should be added in a specified subroutine for short-term fixes
and **not** in a usual scientific or technical namelist. The location of the
temporary logical routine varies by repository, with not all repositories
requiring their own temporary logical subroutine. Details are as follows:

.. tab-set::

    .. tab-item:: UM

        ``src/control/misc/science_fixes_mod.F90``

    .. tab-item:: JULES

        ``src/control/shared/jules_science_fixes_mod.F90``

    .. tab-item:: LFRic Apps

        Currently reads ``science_fixes_mod.F90`` (see UM) into
        ``um_physics/source/support/um_physics_init_mod.f90``

    .. tab-item:: UKCA/CASIM/SOCRATES

        No temporary logical routine currently in place for these projects.
        Consult with Code Owners or check the UM ``science_fixes_mod.F90`` for
        existing temporary logicals.

.. hint::

  By default, the logical should be set to ``.false.``, with the fix switched
  **off**, unless instructed otherwise by the Configuration Owner.

The developer should remember to add the variable
to the namelist, including any namelist printing and reading subroutines present
in the module. In addition, they should also include a warning for when the fix
is not included in a configuration. Examples of the various components can be
found by examining existing variables in the subroutines listed in the table
above.

An upgrade macro and Rose metadata will be required to add the temporary logical
into the GUI and make it available to model users. See :ref:`inputs` for further
information. UM developers are also expected to fill in a
`temporary fixes summary template <https://code.metoffice.gov.uk/trac/um/wiki/PageTemplates/TempFixesSummary>`_
and
`the temporary logical table <https://code.metoffice.gov.uk/trac/um/wiki/TempUMlogicals>`_
prior to the review process.

..
  Note: Have we got a page on upgrade macros? (i.e. brief instructions on how to write one?)
  I wonder if we need one - I can only see a discussion on what they are and how
  to apply one!

  Should the temporary logical page and the summary wiki page be extended to all
  repositories? I can't see one for JULES at the moment. This is something to
  think about making consistent.


After the release cycle
-----------------------

Normally, configuration owners would be expected to switch on all temporary
logicals present as part of developing their latest configuration. This includes
any which do not impact their configuration, as it allows them to be retired
from the code base. Depending on when the next configuration is being developed,
this could be some time after the code is released.

.. note::
  **Very rarely**, switching on a bug fix may have an undesired impact (e.g., it
  leads to the discovery of a bug elsewhere in the code). In these cases, the
  configuration owner may keep the temporary logical set to ``.false.`` until
  the issue is resolved and may consult with the Code Owners and the developers
  of the fix for further guidance. This does not imply that the bug fix wasn't
  sensible in the first place!

Each temporary logical has a review and retention period attached to it. Once
the fix is included within the various configurations it affects, the temporary
logical should be removed from the code base.

.. important::
  Prior to a ticket containing a temporary logical being committed to the trunk,
  the developers is expected to open a new ticket which removes the logical
  after a fixed period. This acts as an aide memoire that the logical needs to
  be removed in due course.
