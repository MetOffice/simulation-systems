Approval Process
================
Every ticket will need to get approval from a group of people. These approvals
are marked on the Ticket Summary wiki page by those signing off the approval.

Code Owners (also Module Leaders)
---------------------------------
Every file in the code bases has a :ref:`code_owner`, and every file changed
will need checking by the code owners - no matter how small the change.
It is always worth talking to the main code owners involved early in the process.
These people have good oversight on changes in an area and will be
able to guide your change to fit in with the bigger picture of what is happening.

A list of current code owners for each project can be found in
`trunk/CodeOwners.txt`.

In some repositories, the code owner(s) will be supported by module leaders who
will sign-off scientifically significant changes to their areas of interest.

Config Owner
------------
:ref:`Configuration Owner's <config_owner>` are responsible for a combination of
settings in the model that achieve a particular aim (e.g. the current GAL or RAL
setup used operationally). Within the rose-stem testing these configurations
will be used and any changes to the answers shown in testing will need sign off
from the config owner.
