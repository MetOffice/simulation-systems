Documentation
-------------
Some projects have their own scientific and technical documentation.
Most notably:

* `The UM has documentation papers <https://code.metoffice.gov.uk/doc/um/latest/umdp.html>`_
* `JULES has a user guide and documentation <https://jules-lsm.github.io/latest/index.html>`_
* `LFRic has some basic documentation <https://code.metoffice.gov.uk/trac/lfric/wiki/LFRicTechnical#Documentation>`_

..
  Any other documentation to be aware of could be added above.

Small changes and bug fixes rarely need documentation to be updated, but when new science is
added to a project, the documentation must be updated to ensure that it remains contemporary
with the code.

.. tip ::
  Searching the relevant documentation for words related to your change is often useful when
  deciding whether to update the documentation.

  (JW: These can be added later if required, but I will leave it for now to get the rest of
  the change development section done. We can open an issue if required.)
