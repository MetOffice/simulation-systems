Testing UKCA
============

Changes in UKCA that touch `src/science` or `src/control/core` must be tested
with both the UM and LFRic by following the :ref:`linked tickets guidance
<multirepo>`.

For further guidance on testing and working with UKCA, including standard
suites and box models see the `UKCA trac wiki
<https://code.metoffice.gov.uk/trac/ukca/wiki/WorkingPractices>`__.
