Support
=======

Level 0- Self help & Peer Support
---------------------------------
Self-help and using the people around you should always be your first port of
call. Time spent here will likely solve your problem or at least better describe
it.

Consider contacting relevant Code, Configuration or Suite Owners.

Level 1- Yammer
---------------
If your problem persists, then use the relevant Yammer groups:

    * `LFRic <https://web.yammer.com/main/groups/eyJfdHlwZSI6Ikdyb3VwIiwiaWQiOiIxMDkwNTczMiJ9/all>`_
    * `UM <https://www.yammer.com/metoffice.gov.uk/#/threads/inGroup?type=in_group&feedId=15288192&view=all>`_
    * `JULES <https://web.yammer.com/main/groups/eyJfdHlwZSI6Ikdyb3VwIiwiaWQiOiIxMTEzMzk5NiJ9/all>`_
    * `Mule <https://web.yammer.com/main/groups/eyJfdHlwZSI6Ikdyb3VwIiwiaWQiOiIxMDQwODU5MCJ9/all>`_

Non Met Office users can request access via the partnerships team:
Scientific_Partnerships@metoffice.gov.uk. Some institutions are presently
unable to access these due to GDPR issues.

Level 2- Support Teams
----------------------
If you still require assistance, then contact the appropriate support team.
Please respect the clear demarcations between the scope for different teams.

Capability Development Team (formally LFRic Team):
   * Support windows for LFRic releases TBC

Simulation Systems and Deployment Team (formerly UM System Team and CRUM team) supports:
   * UM, Shumlib and JULES versions released in the last 12 months,
   * main version used in the Met Office Operational Suite.
   * specific climate configurations .. todo - details of which configs


Escalation
----------
Sometimes things go wrong or different parties disagree. If discussions between
developer, code/config owners and reviewers cannot resolve the situation then it
should be escalated to the manager of the Simulation Systems and Deployment Team
in the first instance. They will consult appropriately to make the best balanced
and impartial decision. If this is unsuccessful, the ultimate (but very rarely
used) decision authority about code that may be committed to the trunk lies with
the UM Project Board.
