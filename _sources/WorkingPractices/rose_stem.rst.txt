Rose Stem Suite
===============

All new changes are strongly encouraged to come with an update to the
rose stem suite to protect any new functionality. Configuration owners may also
wish to update the suite to ensure that important configurations are protected
by the rose stem suite.

.. warning::
  If you find that you need to update all the apps in the rose stem suite
  to get your change to work then you should use an upgrade macro. See :ref:`inputs`.

.. tip::
  Familiarise yourself with the `Rose documentation
  <https://metomi.github.io/rose/2019.01.8/html/tutorial/rose/furthertopics/rose-stem.html>`_
  before continuing with this section.

Adding a new app
----------------

Adding a new app to rose-stem can look daunting, but is actually less difficult
than many other development processes as there are many examples to reference
already in the code.

1. rose-stem/app/

    Start by creating a new app with the details of the test you wish to run.
    This might be an optional configuration for an existing app, or something
    completely new.

    For the UM also create a matching rose-ana app detailing the comparisons
    required.

    Both of these will be easiest to copy an existing app that is similar to what
    you are creating and modify from there. You can use the rose edit gui or
    manually modify the rose-app.conf files.

    .. note::
        The app should validate (i.e. be consistent with the Rose metadata, and
        produce no warnings or errors). This can be checked by running ``rose macro
        --validate --no-warn version -M path/to/rose-meta`` from within your new
        app directory, or selecting Metadata -> Check fail-if, warn-if from the
        drop-down menu of the rose edit gui.

The next steps are site and rose-stem specific, but fall broadly into two
categories - those using a jinja2 templated design which populate runtime and graph
sections for you, such as the UM METO suite, and those which are manually configured,
such as JULES.

        2. Task definitions

            Task definitions should be added to the tasks.rc for all sites who
            will run this app.

            The tasks are defined in a dictionary format, with one entry per
            configuration and all other details are handled by the templates.
            It is possible to define multiple decomposition and thread
            options in this single entry and comparison details are also defined
            within that same dictionary entry.

            Details of the available options are listed in the template files
            in ``rose-stem/templates`` for each suite and looking at existing examples
            is encouraged.

        2. Task definitions

            Task definitions for the following tasks should be added to the
            runtime.rc for all sites who will run this app.

                * run the app
                * perform a KGO comparison
                * perform housekeeping

        3. Graph definitions

            Graph definitions should be added to the graph.rc for all sites who
            will run this app. These should connect together your new tasks
            created above with an appropriate build task.

.. tip::
    The site specific information is held in:
        * JULES: rose-stem/include
        * UM: rose-stem/site

.. tip::
    All `*.rc` files mentioned are frequently split into platform specific
    variants depending on the complexity of the sites suite.

    e.g. `runtime.rc` may be spread across `runtime-platform1.rc` and `runtime-platform2.rc`.
    If a task should be run on both platform1 and platform2 then both of these
    will need the task definition adding.
