Simulation Systems Working Practices
====================================

**These pages describe the working practices of the following simulation and
model codes owned by the Met Office; UM, LFRic Applications, JULES and UKCA.**

This includes how to get started, key points on developing your change and how
to test those developments. There is guidance on making changes that span multiple
projects and how to progress your change through review.

There are then notes for reviewers on how to tackle the different types of review
and how to commit to the trunk.
